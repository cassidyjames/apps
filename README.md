# Apps

Collection of apps that I want to make/wish existed for elementary OS. Sketches/wireframes might exist for some of these; if you're interested in taking one of these on, let me know.

- [ ] [**Anamorph**](https://github.com/cassidyjames/anamorph): De-squeeze anamorphic footage, i.e. that shot with a Moment Anamorphic lens.

- [] **Backdrop**: Small collection of curated wallpapers just for elementary OS. Maybe using an Unsplash collection as a back-end, or just shipping the wallpapers with the app.

- [ ] **Clack**: A simple, no-frills notepad sort of app. Just the bare minimum needed to spit some text into a .txt file.

- [x] [**Clairvoyant](https://github.com/cassidyjames/clairvoyant): Magic 8-ball applet.

- [ ] [**Codestash**](https://github.com/cassidyjames/codestash): Stash your code for later. Inspired by [SourceNote for Mac](https://www.sourcenoteapp.com/).

- [x] [**Dippi**](https://github.com/cassidyjames/dippi): Calculate display info like DPI and aspect ratio, helping with laptop/display purchasing decisions.

- [x] [**Ephemeral**](https://github.com/cassidyjames/ephemeral): A private-by-default, always-incognito browser. Like Firefox Focus. Share to your other browsers with one click.

- [x] [**Ideogram**](https://github.com/cassidyjames/ideogram): Insert emoji anywhere, even in non-native apps. Displays a GTK Emoji Picker, and then copies that to the clipboard, then pastes it.

- [ ] **Lyra**: Get lyrics and meaning for almost any song. Powered by the Genius API. Hook into MPRIS to see what's playing, but also search for songs/lyrics.

- [x] [**Palette**](https://github.com/cassidyjames/palette): View and copy colors from the elementary brand palette, including semantic uses, HEX values, and GTK color constants.

- [x] [**Principles**](https://github.com/cassidyjames/principles): Remember Dieter Rams' ten principles of good design with an applet. Loads a random princple each time, and disappears onto your wallpaper.

- [ ] **Pwatypus**: Turn PWAs into pinned, integrated web apps. Like [Webpin](https://github.com/artemanufrij/webpin), but leaning more on PWA manifests and focusing on as deep of integration as possible.

- [ ] **Roost**: App for Nest smart devices, i.e. thermostat, cams, etc.

- [ ] **Rundown**: Battery rundown app. Use across hardware for consistent/comparable battery stats. Probably needs to do a variety of work behind the scenes, like loading webpages (WebKitGTK), maybe playing videos, occasionally hitting the CPU.

- [ ] **Shortlist**: Better than wishlists. Pick a small number of items you want. This would likely be more a web service with native front-ends for at least elementary OS and Android.

- [ ] **Webshooter**: Your friendly neighborhood website screenshooter. Grab full-size screenshots of web pages at predefined sizes. Great for sharing prototypes.
