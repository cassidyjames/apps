# Apps

Collection of apps that I want to make/wish existed for elementary OS

- [ ] **Webshooter**: Your friendly neighborhood website screenshooter. Grab full-size screenshots of web pages at predefined sizes. Great for sharing prototypes.
- [ ] **Rundown**: Battery rundown app. Use across hardware for consistent/comparable battery stats. Probably needs to do a variety of work behind the scenes, like loading webpages (WebKitGTK), maybe playing videos, occasionally hitting the CPU.
